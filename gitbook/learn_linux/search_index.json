Commands                                                          PS(1)\n\n\n\nNAME\n       ps - report a snapshot of the current processes.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       ps [options]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       ps displays information about a selection of the active processes.  If you want a repetitive update of the selection and the\n       displayed information, use top(1) instead.\n\n       This version of ps accepts several kinds of options:\n\n       1   UNIX options, which may be grouped and must be preceded by a dash.\n       2   BSD options, which may be grouped and must not be used with a dash.\n       3   GNU long options, which are preceded by two dashes.\n\n       Options of different types may be freely mixed, but conflicts can appear.  There are some synonymous options, which are functionally\n       identical, due to the many standards and ps implementations that this ps is compatible with.\n\n       Note that \"ps -aux\" is distinct from \"ps aux\".  The POSIX and UNIX standards require that \"ps -aux\" print all processes owned by a\n       user named \"x\", as well as printing all processes that would be selected by the -a option.  If the user named \"x\" does not exist,\n       this ps may interpret the command as \"ps aux\" instead and print a warning.  This behavior is intended to aid in transitioning old\n       scripts and habits.  It is fragile, subject to change, and thus should not be relied upon.\n\n       By default, ps selects all processes with the same effective user ID (euid=EUID) as the current user and associated with the same\n       terminal as the invoker.  It displays the process ID (pid=PID), the terminal associated with the process (tname=TTY), the cumulated\n       CPU time in [DD-]hh:mm:ss format (time=TIME), and the executable name (ucmd=CMD).  Output is unsorted by default.\n\n       The use of BSD-style options will add process state (stat=STAT) to the default display and show the command args (args=COMMAND)\n       instead of the executable name.  You can override this with the PS_FORMAT environment variable. The use of BSD-style options will\n       also change the process selection to include processes on other terminals (TTYs) that are owned by you; alternately, this may be\n       described as setting the selection to be the set of all processes filtered to exclude processes owned by other users or not on a\n       terminal.  These effects are not considered when options are described as being \"identical\" below, so -M will be considered\n       identical to Z and so on.\n\n       Except as described below, process selection options are additive.  The default selection is discarded, and then the selected\n       processes are added to the set of processes to be displayed.  A process will thus be shown if it meets any of the given selection\n       criteria.\n\nEXAMPLES\n       To see every process on the system using standard syntax:\n          ps -e\n          ps -ef\n          ps -eF\n          ps -ely\n\n       To see every process on the system using BSD syntax:\n          ps ax\n          ps axu\n\n       To print a process tree:\n          ps -ejH\n          ps axjf\n\n       To get info about threads:\n          ps -eLf\n          ps axms\n\n       To get security info:\n          ps -eo euser,ruser,suser,fuser,f,comm,label\n          ps axZ\n          ps -eM\n\n       To see every process running as root (real & effective ID) in user format:\n          ps -U root -u root u\n\n       To see every process with a user-defined format:\n          ps -eo pid,tid,class,rtprio,ni,pri,psr,pcpu,stat,wchan:14,comm\n          ps axo stat,euid,ruid,tty,tpgid,sess,pgrp,ppid,pid,pcpu,comm\n          ps -Ao pid,tt,user,fname,tmout,f,wchan\n\n       Print only the process IDs of syslogd:\n          ps -C syslogd -o pid=\n\n       Print only the name of PID 42:\n          ps -q 42 -o comm=\n\nSIMPLE PROCESS SELECTION\n       a      Lift the BSD-style \"only yourself\" restriction, which is imposed upon the set of all processes when some BSD-style (without\n              \"-\") options are used or when the ps personality setting is BSD-like.  The set of processes selected in this manner is in\n              addition to the set of processes selected by other means.  An alternate description is that this option causes ps to list all\n              processes with a terminal (tty), or to list all processes when used together with the x option.\n\n       -A     Select all processes.  Identical to -e.\n\n       -a     Select all processes except both session leaders (see getsid(2)) and processes not associated with a terminal.\n\n       -d     Select all processes except session leaders.\n\n       --deselect\n              Select all processes except those that fulfill the specified conditions (negates the selection).  Identical to -N.\n\n       -e     Select all processes.  Identical to -A.\n\n       g      Really all, even session leaders.  This flag is obsolete and may be discontinued in a future release.  It is normally implied\n              by the a flag, and is only useful when operating in the sunos4 personality.\n\n       -N     Select all processes except those that fulfill the specified conditions (negates the selection).  Identical to --deselect.\n\n       T      Select all processes associated with this terminal.  Identical to the t option without any argument.\n\n       r      Restrict the selection to only running processes.\n\n       x      Lift the BSD-style \"must have a tty\" restriction, which is imposed upon the set of all processes when some BSD-style (without\n              \"-\") options are used or when the ps personality setting is BSD-like.  The set of processes selected in this manner is in\n              addition to the set of processes selected by other means.  An alternate description is that this option causes ps to list all\n              processes owned by you (same EUID as ps), or to list all processes when used together with the a option.\n\nPROCESS SELECTION BY LIST\n       These options accept a single argument in the form of a blank-separated or comma-separated list.  They can be used multiple times.\n       For example: ps -p \"1 2\" -p 3,4\n\n       -123   Identical to --pid 123.\n\n       123    Identical to --pid 123.\n\n       -C cmdlist\n              Select by command name.  This selects the processes whose executable name is given in cmdlist.\n\n       -G grplist\n              Select by real group ID (RGID) or name.  This selects the processes whose real group name or ID is in the grplist list.  The\n              real group ID identifies the group of the user who created the process, see getgid(2).\n\n       -g grplist\n              Select by session OR by effective group name.  Selection by session is specified by many standards, but selection by\n              effective group is the logical behavior that several other operating systems use.  This ps will select by session when the\n              list is completely numeric (as sessions are).  Group ID numbers will work only when some group names are also specified.  See\n              the -s and --group options.\n\n       --Group grplist\n              Select by real group ID (RGID) or name.  Identical to -G.\n\n       --group grplist\n              Select by effective group ID (EGID) or name.  This selects the processes whose effective group name or ID is in grplist.  The\n              effective group ID describes the group whose file access permissions are used by the process (see getegid(2)).  The -g option\n              is often an alternative to --group.\n\n       p pidlist\n              Select by process ID.  Identical to -p and --pid.\n\n       -p pidlist\n              Select by PID.  This selects the processes whose process ID numbers appear in pidlist.  Identical to p and --pid.\n\n       --pid pidlist\n              Select by process ID.  Identical to -p and p.\n\n       --ppid pidlist\n              Select by parent process ID.  This selects the processes with a parent process ID in pidlist.  That is, it selects processes\n              that are children of those listed in pidlist.\n\n       q pidlist\n              Select by process ID (quick mode).  Identical to -q and --quick-pid.\n\n       -q pidlist\n              Select by PID (quick mode).  This selects the processes whose process ID numbers appear in pidlist.  With this option ps\n              reads the necessary info only for the pids listed in the pidlist and doesn't apply additional filtering rules. The order of\n              pids is unsorted and preserved. No additional selection options, sorting and forest type listings are allowed in this mode.\n              Identical to q and --quick-pid.\n\n       --quick-pid pidlist\n              Select by process ID (quick mode).  Identical to -q and q.\n\n       -s sesslist\n              Select by session ID.  This selects the processes with a session ID specified in sesslist.\n\n       --sid sesslist\n              Select by session ID.  Identical to -s.\n\n       t ttylist\n              Select by tty.  Nearly identical to -t and --tty, but can also be used with an empty ttylist to indicate the terminal\n              associated with ps.  Using the T option is considered cleaner than using t with an empty ttylist.\n\n       -t ttylist\n              Select by tty.  This selects the processes associated with the terminals given in ttylist.  Terminals (ttys, or screens for\n              text output) can be specified in several forms: /dev/ttyS1, ttyS1, S1.  A plain \"-\" may be used to select processes not\n              attached to any terminal.\n\n       --tty ttylist\n              Select by terminal.  Identical to -t and t.\n\n       U userlist\n              Select by effective user ID (EUID) or name.  This selects the processes whose effective user name or ID is in userlist.  The\n              effective user ID describes the user whose file access permissions are used by the process (see geteuid(2)).  Identical to -u\n              and --user.\n\n       -U userlist\n              Select by real user ID (RUID) or name.  It selects the processes whose real user name or ID is in the userlist list.  The\n              real user ID identifies the user who created the process, see getuid(2).\n\n       -u userlist\n              Select by effective user ID (EUID) or name.  This selects the processes whose effective user name or ID is in userlist.\n\n              The effective user ID describes the user whose file access permissions are used by the process (see geteuid(2)).  Identical\n              to U and --user.\n\n       --User userlist\n              Select by real user ID (RUID) or name.  Identical to -U.\n\n       --user userlist\n              Select by effective user ID (EUID) or name.  Identical to -u and U.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT CONTROL\n       These options are used to choose the information displayed by ps.  The output may differ by personality.\n\n       -c     Show different scheduler information for the -l option.\n\n       --context\n              Display security context format (for SELinux).\n\n       -f     Do full-format listing. This option can be combined with many other UNIX-style options to add additional columns.  It also\n              causes the command arguments to be printed.  When used with -L, the NLWP (number of threads) and LWP (thread ID) columns will\n              be added.  See the c option, the format keyword args, and the format keyword comm.\n\n       -F     Extra full format.  See the -f option, which -F implies.\n\n       --format format\n              user-defined format.  Identical to -o and o.\n\n       j      BSD job control format.\n\n       -j     Jobs format.\n\n       l      Display BSD long format.\n\n       -l     Long format.  The -y option is often useful with this.\n\n       -M     Add a column of security data.  Identical to Z (for SELinux).\n\n       O format\n              is preloaded o (overloaded).  The BSD O option can act like -O (user-defined output format with some common fields\n              predefined) or can be used to specify sort order.  Heuristics are used to determine the behavior of this option.  To ensure\n              that the desired behavior is obtained (sorting or formatting), specify the option in some other way (e.g.  with -O or\n              --sort).  When used as a formatting option, it is identical to -O, with the BSD personality.\n\n       -O format\n              Like -o, but preloaded with some default columns.  Identical to -o pid,format,state,tname,time,command or -o pid,format,\n              tname,time,cmd, see -o below.\n\n       o format\n              Specify user-defined format.  Identical to -o and --format.\n\n       -o format\n              User-defined format.  format is a single argument in the form of a blank-separated or comma-separated list, which offers a\n              way to specify individual output columns.  The recognized keywords are described in the STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS section\n              below.  Headers may be renamed (ps -o pid,ruser=RealUser -o comm=Command) as desired.  If all column headers are empty (ps -o\n              pid= -o comm=) then the header line will not be output.  Column width will increase as needed for wide headers; this may be\n              used to widen up columns such as WCHAN (ps -o pid,wchan=WIDE-WCHAN-COLUMN -o comm).  Explicit width control (ps opid,\n              wchan:42,cmd) is offered too.  The behavior of ps -o pid=X,comm=Y varies with personality; output may be one column named \"X,\n              comm=Y\" or two columns named \"X\" and \"Y\".  Use multiple -o options when in doubt.  Use the PS_FORMAT environment variable to\n              specify a default as desired; DefSysV and DefBSD are macros that may be used to choose the default UNIX or BSD columns.\n\n       s      Display signal format.\n\n       u      Display user-oriented format.\n\n       v      Display virtual memory format.\n\n       X      Register format.\n\n       -y     Do not show flags; show rss in place of addr.  This option can only be used with -l.\n\n       Z      Add a column of security data.  Identical to -M (for SELinux).\n\nOUTPUT MODIFIERS\n       c      Show the true command name.  This is derived from the name of the executable file, rather than from the argv value.  Command\n              arguments and any modifications to them are thus not shown.  This option effectively turns the args format keyword into the\n              comm format keyword; it is useful with the -f format option and with the various BSD-style format options, which all normally\n              display the command arguments.  See the -f option, the format keyword args, and the format keyword comm.\n\n       --cols n\n              Set screen width.\n\n       --columns n\n              Set screen width.\n\n       --cumulative\n              Include some dead child process data (as a sum with the parent).\n\n       e      Show the environment after the command.\n\n       f      ASCII art process hierarchy (forest).\n\n       --forest\n              ASCII art process tree.\n\n       h      No header.  (or, one header per screen in the BSD personality).  The h option is problematic.  Standard BSD ps uses this\n              option to print a header on each page of output, but older Linux ps uses this option to totally disable the header.  This\n              version of ps follows the Linux usage of not printing the header unless the BSD personality has been selected, in which case\n              it prints a header on each page of output.  Regardless of the current personality, you can use the long options --headers and\n              --no-headers to enable printing headers each page or disable headers entirely, respectively.\n\n       -H     Show process hierarchy (forest).\n\n       --headers\n              Repeat header lines, one per page of output.\n\n       k spec Specify sorting order.  Sorting syntax is [+|-]key[,[+|-]key[,...]].  Choose a multi-letter key from the STANDARD FORMAT\n              SPECIFIERS section.  The \"+\" is optional since default direction is increasing numerical or lexicographic order.  Identical\n              to --sort.\n\n                      Examples:\n                      ps jaxkuid,-ppid,+pid\n                      ps axk comm o comm,args\n                      ps kstart_time -ef\n\n       --lines n\n              Set screen height.\n\n       -n namelist\n              Set namelist file.  Identical to N.  The namelist file is needed for a proper WCHAN display, and must match the current Linux\n              kernel exactly for correct output.  Without this option, the default search path for the namelist is:\n\n                      $PS_SYSMAP\n                      $PS_SYSTEM_MAP\n                      /proc/*/wchan\n                      /boot/System.map-$(uname -r)\n                      /boot/System.map\n                      /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/System.map\n                      /usr/src/linux/System.map\n                      /System.map\n\n       n      Numeric output for WCHAN and USER (including all types of UID and GID).\n\n       N namelist\n              Specify namelist file.  Identical to -n, see -n above.\n\n       --no-headers\n              Print no header line at all.  --no-heading is an alias for this option.\n\n       O order\n              Sorting order (overloaded).  The BSD O option can act like -O (user-defined output format with some common fields predefined)\n              or can be used to specify sort order.  Heuristics are used to determine the behavior of this option.  To ensure that the\n              desired behavior is obtained (sorting or formatting), specify the option in some other way (e.g.  with -O or --sort).\n\n              For sorting, obsolete BSD O option syntax is O[+|-]k1[,[+|-]k2[,...]].  It orders the processes listing according to the\n              multilevel sort specified by the sequence of one-letter short keys k1,k2, ...  described in the OBSOLETE SORT KEYS section\n              below.  The \"+\" is currently optional, merely re-iterating the default direction on a key, but may help to distinguish an O\n              sort from an O format.  The \"-\" reverses direction only on the key it precedes.\n\n       --rows n\n              Set screen height.\n\n       S      Sum up some information, such as CPU usage, from dead child processes into their parent.  This is useful for examining a\n              system where a parent process repeatedly forks off short-lived children to do work.\n\n       --sort spec\n              Specify sorting order.  Sorting syntax is [+|-]key[,[+|-]key[,...]].  Choose a multi-letter key from the STANDARD FORMAT\n              SPECIFIERS section.  The \"+\" is optional since default direction is increasing numerical or lexicographic order.  Identical\n              to k.  For example: ps jax --sort=uid,-ppid,+pid\n\n       w      Wide output.  Use this option twice for unlimited width.\n\n       -w     Wide output.  Use this option twice for unlimited width.\n\n       --width n\n              Set screen width.\n\nTHREAD DISPLAY\n       H      Show threads as if they were processes.\n\n       -L     Show threads, possibly with LWP and NLWP columns.\n\n       m      Show threads after processes.\n\n       -m     Show threads after processes.\n\n       -T     Show threads, possibly with SPID column.\n\nOTHER INFORMATION\n       --help section\n              Print a help message.  The section argument can be one of simple, list, output, threads, misc or all.  The argument can be\n              shortened to one of the underlined letters as in: s|l|o|t|m|a.\n\n       --info Print debugging info.\n\n       L      List all format specifiers.\n\n       V      Print the procps-ng version.\n\n       -V     Print the procps-ng version.\n\n       --version\n              Print the procps-ng version.\n\nNOTES\n       This ps works by reading the virtual files in /proc.  This ps does not need to be setuid kmem or have any privileges to run.  Do not\n       give this ps any special permissions.\n\n       This ps needs access to namelist data for proper WCHAN display.  For kernels prior to 2.6, the System.map file must be installed.\n\n       CPU usage is currently expressed as the percentage of time spent running during the entire lifetime of a process.  This is not\n       ideal, and it does not conform to the standards that ps otherwise conforms to.  CPU usage is unlikely to add up to exactly 100%.\n\n       The SIZE and RSS fields don't count some parts of a process including the page tables, kernel stack, struct thread_info, and struct\n       task_struct.  This is usually at least 20 KiB of memory that is always resident.  SIZE is the virtual size of the process (code+\n       data+stack).\n\n       Processes marked  are dead processes (so-called \"zombies\") that remain because their parent has not destroyed them\n       properly.  These processes will be destroyed by init(8) if the parent process exits.\n\n       If the length of the username is greater than the length of the display column, the numeric user ID is displayed instead.\n\n       Commands options such as ps -aux are not recommended as it is a confusion of two different standards.  According to the POSIX and\n       UNIX standards, the above command asks to display all processes with a TTY (generally the commands users are running) plus all\n       processes owned by a user named \"x\".  If that user doesn't exist, then ps will assume you really meant \"ps aux\".\n\nPROCESS FLAGS\n       The sum of these values is displayed in the \"F\" column, which is provided by the flags output specifier:\n\n               1    forked but didn't exec\n               4    used super-user privileges\n\nPROCESS STATE CODES\n       Here are the different values that the s, stat and state output specifiers (header \"STAT\" or \"S\") will display to describe the state\n       of a process:\n\n               D    uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)\n               R    running or runnable (on run queue)\n               S    interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)\n               T    stopped by job control signal\n               t    stopped by debugger during the tracing\n               W    paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)\n               X    dead (should never be seen)\n               Z    defunct (\"zombie\") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent\n\n       For BSD formats and when the stat keyword is used, additional characters may be displayed:\n\n                is partly dead, waiting to be fully destroyed by its\n                             parent.  Sometimes the process args will be unavailable; when this happens, ps will instead print the\n                             executable name in brackets.  (alias cmd, command).  See also the comm format keyword, the -f option, and the\n                             c option.\n                             When specified last, this column will extend to the edge of the display.  If ps can not determine display\n                             width, as when output is redirected (piped) into a file or another command, the output width is undefined (it\n                             may be 80, unlimited, determined by the TERM variable, and so on).  The COLUMNS environment variable or --cols\n                             option may be used to exactly determine the width in this case.  The w or -w option may be also be used to\n                             adjust width.\n\n       blocked     BLOCKED   mask of the blocked signals, see signal(7).  According to the width of the field, a 32 or 64-bit mask in\n                             hexadecimal format is displayed.  (alias sig_block, sigmask).\n\n       bsdstart    START     time the command started.  If the process was started less than 24 hours ago, the output format is \" HH:MM\",\n                             else it is \" Mmm:SS\" (where Mmm is the three letters of the month).  See also lstart, start, start_time,\n                             and stime.\n\n       bsdtime     TIME      accumulated cpu time, user + system.  The display format is usually \"MMM:SS\", but can be shifted to the right\n                             if the process used more than 999 minutes of cpu time.\n\n\n       c           C         processor utilization.

It was designed to exercise various physical subsystems of\n       a computer as well as the various operating system kernel interfaces.  stress-ng also has a wide range of CPU specific stress  tests\n       that exercise floating point, integer, bit manipulation and control flow.\n\n       stress-ng was originally intended to make a machine work hard and trip hardware issues such as thermal overruns as well as operating\n       system bugs that only occur when a system is being thrashed hard. Use stress-ng with caution as some of the tests can make a  system\n       run hot on poorly designed hardware and also can cause excessive system thrashing which may be difficult to stop.\n\n       stress-ng  can also measure test throughput rates; this can be useful to observe performance changes across different operating sys‐\n       tem releases or types of hardware. However, it has never been intended to be used as a precise benchmark test suite, so do  NOT  use\n       it in this manner.\n\n       Running  stress-ng  with root privileges will adjust out of memory settings on Linux systems to make the stressors unkillable in low\n       memory situations, so use this judiciously.  With the appropriate privilege, stress-ng can allow the ionice class and ionice  levels\n       to be adjusted, again, this should be used with care.\n\n       One  can specify the number of processes to invoke per type of stress test; specifying a negative or zero value will select the num‐\n       ber of processors available as defined by sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF).\n\nOPTIONS\n       General stress-ng control options:\n\n       --aggressive\n              enables more file, cache and memory aggressive options. This may slow tests down, increase latencies and reduce the number of\n              bogo ops as well as changing the balance of user time vs system time used depending on the type of stressor being used.\n\n       -a N, --all N\n              start  N  instances  of  each  stressor.  If  N  is  less than zero, then the number of CPUs online is used for the number of\n              instances.  If N is zero, then the number of CPUs in the system is used.\n\n       -b N, --backoff N\n              wait N microseconds between the start of each stress worker process. This allows one to ramp up the stress tests over time.\n\n       --class name\n              specify the class of stressors to run. Stressors are classified into one or more of the following  classes:  cpu,  cpu-cache,\n              device, io, interrupt, filesystem, memory, network, os, pipe, scheduler and vm.  Some stressors fall into just one class. For\n              example the 'get' stressor is just in the 'os' class. Other stressors fall  into  more  than  one  class,  for  example,  the\n              'lsearch'  stressor falls into the 'cpu', 'cpu-cache' and 'memory' classes as it exercises all these three.  Selecting a spe‐\n              cific class will run all the stressors that fall into that class only when run with the --sequential option.\n\n              Specifying a name followed by a question mark (for example --class vm?) will print out all the  stressors  in  that  specific\n              class.\n\n       -n, --dry-run\n              parse options, but do not run stress tests. A no-op.\n\n       -h, --help\n              show help.\n\n       --ignite-cpu\n              alter  kernel  controls  to  try and maximize the CPU. This requires root privilege to alter various /sys interface controls.\n              Currently this only works for Intel P-State enabled x86 systems on Linux.\n\n       --ionice-class class\n              specify ionice class (only on Linux). Can be idle (default), besteffort, be, realtime, rt.\n\n       --ionice-level level\n              specify ionice level (only on Linux). For idle, 0 is the only possible option. For besteffort or realtime values  0  (highest\n              priority) to 7 (lowest priority). See ionice(1) for more details.\n\n       -k, --keep-name\n              by  default,  stress-ng will attempt to change the name of the stress processes according to their functionality; this option\n              disables this and keeps the process names to be the name of the parent process, that is, stress-ng.\n\n       --log-brief\n              by default stress-ng will report the name of the program, the message type and the process id as a prefix to all output.  The\n              --log-brief option will output messages without these fields to produce a less verbose output.\n\n       --log-file filename\n              write messages to the specified log file.\n\n       --maximize\n              overrides the default stressor settings and instead sets these to the maximum settings allowed.  These defaults can always be\n              overridden by the per stressor settings options if required.\n\n       --metrics\n              output number of bogo operations in total performed by the stress processes.  Note that these are not a  reliable  metric  of\n              performance  or  throughput  and have not been designed to be used for benchmarking whatsoever. The metrics are just a useful\n              way to observe how a system behaves when under various kinds of load.\n\n              The following columns of information are output:\n\n              Column Heading             Explanation\n              bogo ops                   number of iterations of the stressor during the run. This is metric of how much overall \"work\" has\n                                         been achieved in bogo operations.\n              real time (secs)           average wall clock duration (in seconds) of the stressor. This is the total wall clock time of all\n                                         the instances of that particular stressor divided by the number of these stressors being run.\n              usr time (secs)            total user time (in seconds) consumed running all the instances of the stressor.\n              sys time (secs)            total system time (in seconds) consumed running all the instances of the stressor.\n              bogo ops/s (real time)     total bogo operations per second based on wall clock run time. The wall clock  time  reflects  the\n                                         apparent  run time. The more processors one has on a system the more the work load can be distrib‐\n                                         uted onto these and hence the wall clock time will reduce and the bogo  ops  rate  will  increase.\n                                         This is essentially the \"apparent\" bogo ops rate of the system.\n              bogo ops/s (usr+sys time)  total  bogo operations per second based on cumulative user and system time.  This is the real bogo\n                                         ops rate of the system taking into consideration the actual time execution time  of  the  stressor\n                                         across all the processors.  Generally this will decrease as one adds more concurrent stressors due\n                                         to contention on cache, memory, execution units, buses and I/O devices.\n\n       --metrics-brief\n              enable metrics and only output metrics that are non-zero.\n\n       --minimize\n              overrides the default stressor settings and instead sets these to the minimum settings allowed.  These defaults can always be\n              overridden by the per stressor settings options if required.\n\n       --no-advise\n              from  version  0.02.26  stress-ng  automatically  calls  madvise(2) with random advise options before each mmap and munmap to\n              stress the the vm subsystem a little harder. The --no-advise option turns this default off.\n\n       --no-rand-seed\n              Do not seed the stress-ng psuedo-random number generator with a quasi random start seed, but instead seed  it  with  constant\n              values.  This  forces tests to run each time using the same start conditions which can be useful when one requires reproduce‐\n              able stress tests.\n\n       --oomable\n              Do not respawn a stressor if it gets killed by the Out-of-Memory (OOM) killer.  The default behaviour is  to  restart  a  new\n              instance of a stressor if the kernel OOM killer terminates the process. This option disables this default behaviour.\n\n       --page-in\n              touch allocated pages that are not in core, forcing them to be paged back in.  This is a useful option to force all the allo‐\n              cated pages to be paged in when using the bigheap, mmap and vm stressors.  It will severely degrade performance when the mem‐\n              ory  in the system is less than the allocated buffer sizes.  This uses mincore(2) to determine the pages that are not in core\n              and hence need touching to page them back in.\n\n       --pathological\n              enable stressors that are known to hang systems.  Some stressors can quickly consume resources in such a way  that  they  can\n              rapidly  hang  a  system before the kernel can OOM kill them. These stressors are not enabled by default, this option enables\n              them, but you probably don't want to do this. You have been warned.\n\n       --perf measure processor and system activity using perf events. Linux only  and  caveat  emptor,  according  to  perf_event_open(2):\n              \"Always double-check your results! Various generalized events have had wrong values.\".  Note that with Linux 4.7 one needs to\n              have CAP_SYS_ADMIN capabilities for this option to work, or adjust  /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid to below  2  to  use\n              this without CAP_SYS_ADMIN.\n\n       -q, --quiet\n              do not show any output.\n\n       -r N, --random N\n              start N random stress workers. If N is 0, then the number of configured processors is used for N.\n\n       --sched scheduler\n              select the named scheduler (only on Linux). To see the list of available schedulers use: stress-ng --sched which\n\n       --sched-prio prio\n              select  the  scheduler priority level (only on Linux). If the scheduler does not support this then the default priority level\n              of 0 is chosen.\n\n       --sequential N\n              sequentially run all the stressors one by one for a default of 60 seconds. The number of instances of each of the  individual\n              stressors  to  be  started is N.  If N is less than zero, then the number of CPUs online is used for the number of instances.\n              If N is zero, then the number of CPUs in the system is used.  Use the --timeout option to specify the duration  to  run  each\n              stressor.\n\n       --stressors\n              output the names of the available stressors.\n\n       --syslog\n              log output (except for verbose -v messages) to the syslog.\n\n       --taskset list\n              set  CPU  affinity based on the list of CPUs provided; stress-ng is bound to just use these CPUs (Linux only). The CPUs to be\n              used are specified by a comma separated list of CPU (0 to N-1). One can specify a range  of  CPUs  using  '-',  for  example:\n              --taskset 0,2-3,6,7-11\n\n       --temp-path path\n              specify  a  path  for stress-ng temporary directories and temporary files; the default path is the current working directory.\n              This path must have read and write access for the stress-ng stress processes.\n\n       --thrash\n              This can only be used when running on Linux and with root privilege. This option starts a background  thrasher  process  that\n              works  through  all  the processes on a system and tries to page as many pages in the processes as possible.  This will cause\n              considerable amount of thrashing of swap on an over-committed system.\n\n       -t N, --timeout N\n              stop stress test after N seconds. One can also specify the units of time in seconds, minutes, hours, days or years  with  the\n              suffix s, m, h, d or y.\n\n       --timer-slack N\n              adjust  the  per  process timer slack to N nanoseconds (Linux only). Increasing the timer slack allows the kernel to coalesce\n              timer events by adding some fuzzinesss to timer expiration times and hence reduce wakeups.  Conversely, decreasing the  timer\n              slack will increase wakeups.  A value of 0 for the timer-slack will set the system default of 50,000 nanoseconds.\n\n       --times\n              show  the cumulative user and system times of all the child processes at the end of the stress run.  The percentage of utili‐\n              sation of available CPU time is also calculated from the number of on-line CPUs in the system.\n\n       --tz   collect temperatures from the available thermal zones on the machine (Linux only).  Some devices may have one or more thermal\n              zones, where as others may have none.\n\n       -v, --verbose\n              show all debug, warnings and normal information output.\n\n       --verify\n              verify results when a test is run. This is not available on all tests. This will sanity check the computations or memory con‐\n              tents from a test run and report to stderr any unexpected failures.\n\n       -V, --version\n              show version.\n\n       -x, --exclude list\n              specify a list of one or more stressors to exclude (that is, do not run them).  This is useful to exclude specific  stressors\n              when  one  selects many stressors to run using the --class option, --sequential, --all and --random options. Example, run the\n              cpu class stressors concurrently and exclude the numa and search stressors:\n\n              stress-ng --class cpu --all 1 -x numa,bsearch,hsearch,lsearch\n\n       -Y, --yaml filename\n              output gathered statistics to a YAML formatted file named 'filename'.\n\n\n\n       Stressor specific options:\n\n       --affinity N\n              start N workers that rapidly change CPU affinity (only on Linux). Rapidly switching CPU affinity can contribute to poor cache\n              behaviour.\n\n       --affinity-ops N\n              stop affinity workers after N bogo affinity operations (only on Linux).\n\n       --affinity-rand\n              switch CPU affinity randomly rather than the default of sequentially.\n\n       --af-alg N\n              start  N  workers  that exercise the AF_ALG socket domain by hashing and encrypting various sized random messages. This exer‐\n              cises the SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, MD4, MD5, RMD128,  RMD160,  RMD256,  RMD320,  WP256,  WP384,  WP512,  TGR128,\n              TGR160,  TGR192  hashes  and  the  cbc(aes),  lrw(aes),  ofb(aes),  xts(twofish),  xts(serpent),  xts(cast6),  xts(camellia),\n              lrw(twofish), lrw(cast6), lrw(camellia), salsa20 skcipers.\n\n       --af-alg-ops N\n              stop af-alg workers after N AF_ALG messages are hashed.\n\n       --aio N\n              start N workers that issue multiple small asynchronous I/O writes and reads on a relatively small temporary  file  using  the\n              POSIX  aio interface.  This will just hit the file system cache and soak up a lot of user and kernel time in issuing and han‐\n              dling I/O requests.  By default, each worker process will handle 16 concurrent I/O requests.\n\n       --aio-ops N\n              stop POSIX asynchronous I/O workers after N bogo asynchronous I/O requests.\n\n       --aio-requests N\n              specify the number of POSIX asynchronous I/O requests each worker should issue, the default is 16; 1 to 4096 are allowed.\n\n       --aiol N\n              start N workers that issue multiple 4K random asynchronous I/O writes using the Linux aio system calls  io_setup(2),  io_sub‐\n              mit(2), io_getevents(2) and io_destroy(2).  By default, each worker process will handle 16 concurrent I/O requests.\n\n       --aiol-ops N\n              stop Linux asynchronous I/O workers after N bogo asynchronous I/O requests.\n\n       --aiol-requests N\n              specify the number of Linux asynchronous I/O requests each worker should issue, the default is 16; 1 to 4096 are allowed.\n\n       --apparmor N\n              start  N  workers that exercise various parts of the AppArmor interface. Currently one needs root permission to run this par‐\n              ticular test. This test is only available on Linux systems with AppArmor support.\n\n       --apparmor-ops\n              stop the AppArmor workers after N bogo operations.\n\n       --atomic N\n              start N workers that exercise various GCC __atomic_*() built in operations on 8, 16, 32 and 64 bit intergers that are  shared\n              among the N workers. This stressor is only available for builds using GCC 4.7.4 or higher. The stressor forces many front end\n              cache stalls and cache references.\n\n       --atomic-ops N\n              stop the atomic workers after N bogo atomic operations.\n\n       -B N, --bigheap N\n              start N workers that grow their heaps by reallocating memory. If the out of memory killer (OOM) on Linux kills the worker  or\n              the  allocation  fails then the allocating process starts all over again.  Note that the OOM adjustment for the worker is set\n              so that the OOM killer will treat these workers as the first candidate processes to kill.\n\n       --bigheap-ops N\n              stop the big heap workers after N bogo allocation operations are completed.\n\n       --bigheap-growth N\n              specify amount of memory to grow heap by per iteration. Size can be from 4K to 64MB. Default is 64K.\n\n       --bind-mount N\n              start N workers that repeatedly bind mount / to / inside a user namespace. This can consume resources rapidly, forcing out of\n              memory situations. Do not use this stressor unless you want to risk hanging your machine.\n\n       --bind-mount-ops N\n              stop after N bind mount bogo operations.\n\n       --brk N\n              start N workers that grow the data segment by one page at a time using multiple brk(2) calls. Each successfully allocated new\n              page is touched to ensure it is resident in memory.  If an out of memory condition occurs then the test will reset  the  data\n              segment  to the point before it started and repeat the data segment resizing over again.  The process adjusts the out of mem‐\n              ory setting so that it may be killed by the out of memory (OOM) killer before other processes.  If it is killed  by  the  OOM\n              killer then it will be automatically re-started by a monitoring parent process.\n\n       --brk-ops N\n              stop the brk workers after N bogo brk operations.\n\n       --brk-notouch\n              do  not  touch  each  newly  allocated data segment page. This disables the default of touching each newly allocated page and\n              hence avoids the kernel from necessarily backing the page with real physical memory.\n\n       --bsearch N\n              start N workers that binary search a sorted array of 32 bit integers using bsearch(3). By default, there are  65536  elements\n              in the array.  This is a useful method to exercise random access of memory and processor cache.\n\n       --bsearch-ops N\n              stop the bsearch worker after N bogo bsearch operations are completed.\n\n       --bsearch-size N\n              specify the size (number of 32 bit integers) in the array to bsearch. Size can be from 1K to 4M.\n\n       -C N, --cache N\n              start  N  workers that perform random wide spread memory read and writes to thrash the CPU cache.  The code does not intelli‐\n              gently determine the CPU cache configuration and so it may be sub-optimal in producing hit-miss read/write activity for  some\n              processors.\n\n       --cache-fence\n              force write serialization on each store operation (x86 only). This is a no-op for non-x86 architectures.\n\n       --cache-flush\n              force flush cache on each store operation (x86 only). This is a no-op for non-x86 architectures.\n\n       --cache-level N\n              specify  level of cache to exercise (1=L1 cache, 2=L2 cache, 3=L3/LLC cache (the default)).  If the cache hierarchy cannot be\n              determined, built-in defaults will apply.\n\n       --cache-no-affinity\n              do not change processor affinity when --cache is in effect.\n\n       --cache-ops N\n              stop cache thrash workers after N bogo cache thrash operations.\n\n       --cache-prefetch\n              force read prefetch on next read address on architectures that support prefetching.\n\n       --cache-ways N\n              specify the number of cache ways to exercise. This allows a subset of the overall cache size to be exercised.\n\n       --cap N\n              start N workers that read per process capabililties via calls to capget(2) (Linux only).\n\n       --cap-ops N\n              stop after N cap bogo operations.\n\n       --chdir N\n              start N workers that change directory between directories using chdir(2).\n\n       --chdir-ops N\n              stop after N chdir bogo operations.\n\n       --chdir-dirs N\n              exercise chdir on N directories. The default is 8192 directories, this allows 64 to 65536 directories to be used instead.\n\n       --chmod N\n              start N workers that change the file mode bits via chmod(2) and fchmod(2) on the same file. The greater the value for N  then\n              the more contention on the single file.  The stressor will work through all the combination of mode bits.\n\n       --chmod-ops N\n              stop after N chmod bogo operations.\n\n       --chown N\n              start  N  workers that exercise chown(2) on the same file. The greater the value for N then the more contention on the single\n              file.\n\n       --chown-ops N\n              stop the chown workers after N bogo chown(2) operations.\n\n       --chroot N\n              start N workers that exercise chroot(2) on various valid and invalid chroot paths. (Linux only).\n\n       --chroot-ops N\n              stop the chroot workers after N bogo chroot(2) operations.\n\n       --clock N\n              start N workers exercising clocks and POSIX timers. For all known clock types this will exercise clock_getres(2),  clock_get‐\n              time(2)  and  clock_nanosleep(2).   For  all known timers it will create a 50000ns timer and busy poll this until it expires.\n              This stressor will cause frequent context switching.\n\n       --clock-ops N\n              stop clock stress workers after N bogo operations.\n\n       --clone N\n              start N workers that create clones (via the clone(2) system call). This will rapidly try to create a default of  8192  clones\n              that  immediately  die  and  wait  in a zombie state until they are reaped.  Once the maximum number of clones is reached (or\n              clone fails because one has reached the maximum allowed) the oldest clone thread is reaped and a new clone is then created in\n              a  first-in first-out manner, and then repeated.  A random clone flag is selected for each clone to try to exercise different\n              clone operarions.  The clone stressor is a Linux only option.\n\n       --clone-ops N\n              stop clone stress workers after N bogo clone operations.\n\n       --clone-max N\n              try to create as many as N clone threads. This may not be reached if the system limit is less than N.\n\n       --context N\n              start N workers that run three threads that use swapcontext(3) to implement  the  thread-to-thread  context  switching.  This\n              exercises rapid process context saving and restoring and is bandwidth limited by register and memory save and restore rates.\n\n       --context-ops N\n              stop N context workers after N bogo context switches.  In this stressor, 1 bogo op is equivalent to 1000 swapcontext calls.\n\n       --copy-file N\n              start N stressors that copy a file using the Linux copy_file_range(2) system call. 2MB chunks of data are copyied from random\n              locations from one file to random locations to a destination file.  By default, the files are 256 MB in size. Data is  sync'd\n              to the filesystem after each copy_file_range(2) call.\n\n       --copy-file-ops N\n              stop after N copy_file_range() calls.\n\n       --copy-file-bytes N\n              copy  file  size, the default is 256 MB. One can specify the size as % of free space on the file system or in units of Bytes,\n              KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or g.\n\n       -c N, --cpu N\n              start N workers exercising the CPU by sequentially working through all the different CPU stress methods. Instead of  exercis‐\n              ing all the CPU stress methods, one can specify a specific CPU stress method with the --cpu-method option.\n\n       --cpu-ops N\n              stop cpu stress workers after N bogo operations.\n\n       -l P, --cpu-load P\n              load  CPU with P percent loading for the CPU stress workers. 0 is effectively a sleep (no load) and 100 is full loading.  The\n              loading loop is broken into compute time (load%) and sleep time (100% - load%). Accuracy depends on the overall load  of  the\n              processor  and the responsiveness of the scheduler, so the actual load may be different from the desired load.  Note that the\n              number of bogo CPU operations may not be linearly scaled with the load as some systems employ CPU frequency  scaling  and  so\n              heavier loads produce an increased CPU frequency and greater CPU bogo operations.\n\n              Note: This option only applies to the --cpu stressor option and not to all of the cpu class of stressors.\n\n       --cpu-load-slice S\n              note  -  this  option  is  only  useful when --cpu-load is less than 100%. The CPU load is broken into multiple busy and idle\n              cycles. Use this option to specify the duration of a busy time slice.  A negative value for S specifies the number of  itera‐\n              tions to run before idling the CPU (e.g. -30 invokes 30 iterations of a CPU stress loop).  A zero value selects a random busy\n              time between 0 and 0.5 seconds.  A positive value for S specifies the number of milliseconds to run  before  idling  the  CPU\n              (e.g.  100 keeps the CPU busy for 0.1 seconds).  Specifying small values for S lends to small time slices and smoother sched‐\n              uling.  Setting --cpu-load as a relatively low value and --cpu-load-slice to be large will cycle the CPU  between  long  idle\n              and busy cycles and exercise different CPU frequencies.  The thermal range of the CPU is also cycled, so this is a good mech‐\n              anism to exercise the scheduler, frequency scaling and passive/active thermal cooling mechanisms.\n\n              Note: This option only applies to the --cpu stressor option and not to all of the cpu class of stressors.\n\n       --cpu-method method\n              specify a cpu stress method. By default, all the stress methods are exercised sequentially, however one can specify just  one\n              method to be used if required.
