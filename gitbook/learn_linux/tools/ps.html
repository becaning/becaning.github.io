NAME
       ps - report a snapshot of the current processes.

SYNOPSIS
       ps [options]

DESCRIPTION
       ps displays information about a selection of the active processes.  If you want a repetitive update of the selection and the
       displayed information, use top(1) instead.

       This version of ps accepts several kinds of options:

       1   UNIX options, <span class="hljs-built_in">which</span> may be grouped and must be preceded by a dash.
       2   BSD options, <span class="hljs-built_in">which</span> may be grouped and must not be used with a dash.
       3   GNU long options, <span class="hljs-built_in">which</span> are preceded by two dashes.

       Options of different types may be freely mixed, but conflicts can appear.  There are some synonymous options, <span class="hljs-built_in">which</span> are functionally
       identical, due to the many standards and ps implementations that this ps is compatible with.

       Note that <span class="hljs-string">&quot;ps -aux&quot;</span> is distinct from <span class="hljs-string">&quot;ps aux&quot;</span>.  The POSIX and UNIX standards require that <span class="hljs-string">&quot;ps -aux&quot;</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span> all processes owned by a
       user named <span class="hljs-string">&quot;x&quot;</span>, as well as printing all processes that would be selected by the <span class="hljs-_">-a</span> option.  If the user named <span class="hljs-string">&quot;x&quot;</span> does not exist,
       this ps may interpret the <span class="hljs-built_in">command</span> as <span class="hljs-string">&quot;ps aux&quot;</span> instead and <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span> a warning.  This behavior is intended to aid <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> transitioning old
       scripts and habits.  It is fragile, subject to change, and thus should not be relied upon.

       By default, ps selects all processes with the same effective user ID (euid=EUID) as the current user and associated with the same
       terminal as the invoker.  It displays the process ID (pid=PID), the terminal associated with the process (tname=TTY), the cumulated
       CPU time <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> [DD-]hh:mm:ss format (time=TIME), and the executable name (ucmd=CMD).  Output is unsorted by default.

       The use of BSD-style options will add process state (<span class="hljs-built_in">stat</span>=STAT) to the default display and show the <span class="hljs-built_in">command</span> args (args=COMMAND)
       instead of the executable name.  You can override this with the PS_FORMAT environment variable. The use of BSD-style options will
       also change the process selection to include processes on other terminals (TTYs) that are owned by you; alternately, this may be
       described as setting the selection to be the <span class="hljs-built_in">set</span> of all processes filtered to exclude processes owned by other users or not on a
       terminal.  These effects are not considered when options are described as being <span class="hljs-string">&quot;identical&quot;</span> below, so -M will be considered
       identical to Z and so on.

       Except as described below, process selection options are additive.  The default selection is discarded, and <span class="hljs-keyword">then</span> the selected
       processes are added to the <span class="hljs-built_in">set</span> of processes to be displayed.  A process will thus be shown <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> it meets any of the given selection
       criteria.

EXAMPLES
       To see every process on the system using standard syntax:
          ps <span class="hljs-_">-e</span>
          ps -ef
          ps <span class="hljs-_">-e</span>F
          ps -ely

       To see every process on the system using BSD syntax:
          ps ax
          ps axu

       To <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span> a process tree:
          ps -ejH
          ps axjf

       To get info about threads:
          ps <span class="hljs-_">-e</span>Lf
          ps axms

       To get security info:
          ps -eo euser,ruser,suser,fuser,f,comm,label
          ps axZ
          ps <span class="hljs-_">-e</span>M

       To see every process running as root (real &amp; effective ID) <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> user format:
          ps -U root -u root u

       To see every process with a user-defined format:
          ps -eo pid,tid,class,rtprio,ni,pri,psr,pcpu,<span class="hljs-built_in">stat</span>,wchan:14,comm
          ps axo <span class="hljs-built_in">stat</span>,euid,ruid,tty,tpgid,sess,pgrp,ppid,pid,pcpu,comm
          ps -Ao pid,tt,user,fname,tmout,f,wchan

       Print only the process IDs of syslogd:
          ps -C syslogd -o pid=

       Print only the name of PID 42:
          ps -q 42 -o comm=

SIMPLE PROCESS SELECTION
       a      Lift the BSD-style <span class="hljs-string">&quot;only yourself&quot;</span> restriction, <span class="hljs-built_in">which</span> is imposed upon the <span class="hljs-built_in">set</span> of all processes when some BSD-style (without
              <span class="hljs-string">&quot;-&quot;</span>) options are used or when the ps personality setting is BSD-like.  The <span class="hljs-built_in">set</span> of processes selected <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> this manner is <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span>
              addition to the <span class="hljs-built_in">set</span> of processes selected by other means.  An alternate description is that this option causes ps to list all
              processes with a terminal (tty), or to list all processes when used together with the x option.

       -A     Select all processes.  Identical to -e.

       <span class="hljs-_">-a</span>     Select all processes except both session leaders (see getsid(2)) and processes not associated with a terminal.

       <span class="hljs-_">-d</span>     Select all processes except session leaders.

       --deselect
              Select all processes except those that fulfill the specified conditions (negates the selection).  Identical to -N.

       <span class="hljs-_">-e</span>     Select all processes.  Identical to -A.

       g      Really all, even session leaders.  This flag is obsolete and may be discontinued <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> a future release.  It is normally implied
              by the a flag, and is only useful when operating <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> the sunos4 personality.

       -N     Select all processes except those that fulfill the specified conditions (negates the selection).  Identical to --deselect.

       T      Select all processes associated with this terminal.  Identical to the t option without any argument.

       r      Restrict the selection to only running processes.

       x      Lift the BSD-style <span class="hljs-string">&quot;must have a tty&quot;</span> restriction, <span class="hljs-built_in">which</span> is imposed upon the <span class="hljs-built_in">set</span> of all processes when some BSD-style (without
              <span class="hljs-string">&quot;-&quot;</span>) options are used or when the ps personality setting is BSD-like.  The <span class="hljs-built_in">set</span> of processes selected <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> this manner is <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span>
              addition to the <span class="hljs-built_in">set</span> of processes selected by other means.  An alternate description is that this option causes ps to list all
              processes owned by you (same EUID as ps), or to list all processes when used together with the a option.

PROCESS SELECTION BY LIST
       These options accept a single argument <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> the form of a blank-separated or comma-separated list.  They can be used multiple times.
       For example: ps -p <span class="hljs-string">&quot;1 2&quot;</span> -p 3,4

       -123   Identical to --pid 123.

       123    Identical to --pid 123.

       -C cmdlist
              Select by <span class="hljs-built_in">command</span> name.  This selects the processes whose executable name is given <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> cmdlist.

       -G grplist
              Select by real group ID (RGID) or name.  This selects the processes whose real group name or ID is <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> the grplist list.  The
              real group ID identifies the group of the user who created the process, see getgid(2).

       -g grplist
              Select by session OR by effective group name.  Selection by session is specified by many standards, but selection by
              effective group is the logical behavior that several other operating systems use.  This ps will select by session when the
              list is completely numeric (as sessions are).  Group ID numbers will work only when some group names are also specified.  See
              the <span class="hljs-_">-s</span> and --group options.

       --Group grplist
              Select by real group ID (RGID) or name.  Identical to -G.

       --group grplist
              Select by effective group ID (EGID) or name.  This selects the processes whose effective group name or ID is <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> grplist.  The
              effective group ID describes the group whose file access permissions are used by the process (see getegid(2)).  The -g option
              is often an alternative to --group.

       p pidlist
              Select by process ID.  Identical to -p and --pid.

       -p pidlist
              Select by PID.  This selects the processes whose process ID numbers appear <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> pidlist.  Identical to p and --pid.

       --pid pidlist
              Select by process ID.  Identical to -p and p.

       --ppid pidlist
              Select by parent process ID.  This selects the processes with a parent process ID <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> pidlist.  That is, it selects processes
              that are children of those listed <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> pidlist.

       q pidlist
              Select by process ID (quick mode).  Identical to -q and --quick-pid.

       -q pidlist
              Select by PID (quick mode).  This selects the processes whose process ID numbers appear <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> pidlist.  With this option ps
              reads the necessary info only <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> the pids listed <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> the pidlist and doesn<span class="hljs-string">&apos;t apply additional filtering rules. The order of
              pids is unsorted and preserved. No additional selection options, sorting and forest type listings are allowed in this mode.
              Identical to q and --quick-pid.

       --quick-pid pidlist
              Select by process ID (quick mode).  Identical to -q and q.

       -s sesslist
              Select by session ID.  This selects the processes with a session ID specified in sesslist.

       --sid sesslist
              Select by session ID.  Identical to -s.

       t ttylist
              Select by tty.  Nearly identical to -t and --tty, but can also be used with an empty ttylist to indicate the terminal
              associated with ps.  Using the T option is considered cleaner than using t with an empty ttylist.

       -t ttylist
              Select by tty.  This selects the processes associated with the terminals given in ttylist.  Terminals (ttys, or screens for
              text output) can be specified in several forms: /dev/ttyS1, ttyS1, S1.  A plain &quot;-&quot; may be used to select processes not
              attached to any terminal.

       --tty ttylist
              Select by terminal.  Identical to -t and t.

       U userlist
              Select by effective user ID (EUID) or name.  This selects the processes whose effective user name or ID is in userlist.  The
              effective user ID describes the user whose file access permissions are used by the process (see geteuid(2)).  Identical to -u
              and --user.

       -U userlist
              Select by real user ID (RUID) or name.  It selects the processes whose real user name or ID is in the userlist list.  The
              real user ID identifies the user who created the process, see getuid(2).

       -u userlist
              Select by effective user ID (EUID) or name.  This selects the processes whose effective user name or ID is in userlist.

              The effective user ID describes the user whose file access permissions are used by the process (see geteuid(2)).  Identical
              to U and --user.

       --User userlist
              Select by real user ID (RUID) or name.  Identical to -U.

       --user userlist
              Select by effective user ID (EUID) or name.  Identical to -u and U.

OUTPUT FORMAT CONTROL
       These options are used to choose the information displayed by ps.  The output may differ by personality.

       -c     Show different scheduler information for the -l option.

       --context
              Display security context format (for SELinux).

       -f     Do full-format listing. This option can be combined with many other UNIX-style options to add additional columns.  It also
              causes the command arguments to be printed.  When used with -L, the NLWP (number of threads) and LWP (thread ID) columns will
              be added.  See the c option, the format keyword args, and the format keyword comm.

       -F     Extra full format.  See the -f option, which -F implies.

       --format format
              user-defined format.  Identical to -o and o.

       j      BSD job control format.

       -j     Jobs format.

       l      Display BSD long format.

       -l     Long format.  The -y option is often useful with this.

       -M     Add a column of security data.  Identical to Z (for SELinux).

       O format
              is preloaded o (overloaded).  The BSD O option can act like -O (user-defined output format with some common fields
              predefined) or can be used to specify sort order.  Heuristics are used to determine the behavior of this option.  To ensure
              that the desired behavior is obtained (sorting or formatting), specify the option in some other way (e.g.  with -O or
              --sort).  When used as a formatting option, it is identical to -O, with the BSD personality.

       -O format
              Like -o, but preloaded with some default columns.  Identical to -o pid,format,state,tname,time,command or -o pid,format,
              tname,time,cmd, see -o below.

       o format
              Specify user-defined format.  Identical to -o and --format.

       -o format
              User-defined format.  format is a single argument in the form of a blank-separated or comma-separated list, which offers a
              way to specify individual output columns.  The recognized keywords are described in the STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS section
              below.  Headers may be renamed (ps -o pid,ruser=RealUser -o comm=Command) as desired.  If all column headers are empty (ps -o
              pid= -o comm=) then the header line will not be output.  Column width will increase as needed for wide headers; this may be
              used to widen up columns such as WCHAN (ps -o pid,wchan=WIDE-WCHAN-COLUMN -o comm).  Explicit width control (ps opid,
              wchan:42,cmd) is offered too.  The behavior of ps -o pid=X,comm=Y varies with personality; output may be one column named &quot;X,
              comm=Y&quot; or two columns named &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;.  Use multiple -o options when in doubt.  Use the PS_FORMAT environment variable to
              specify a default as desired; DefSysV and DefBSD are macros that may be used to choose the default UNIX or BSD columns.

       s      Display signal format.

       u      Display user-oriented format.

       v      Display virtual memory format.

       X      Register format.

       -y     Do not show flags; show rss in place of addr.  This option can only be used with -l.

       Z      Add a column of security data.  Identical to -M (for SELinux).

OUTPUT MODIFIERS
       c      Show the true command name.  This is derived from the name of the executable file, rather than from the argv value.  Command
              arguments and any modifications to them are thus not shown.  This option effectively turns the args format keyword into the
              comm format keyword; it is useful with the -f format option and with the various BSD-style format options, which all normally
              display the command arguments.  See the -f option, the format keyword args, and the format keyword comm.

       --cols n
              Set screen width.

       --columns n
              Set screen width.

       --cumulative
              Include some dead child process data (as a sum with the parent).

       e      Show the environment after the command.

       f      ASCII art process hierarchy (forest).

       --forest
              ASCII art process tree.

       h      No header.  (or, one header per screen in the BSD personality).  The h option is problematic.  Standard BSD ps uses this
              option to print a header on each page of output, but older Linux ps uses this option to totally disable the header.  This
              version of ps follows the Linux usage of not printing the header unless the BSD personality has been selected, in which case
              it prints a header on each page of output.  Regardless of the current personality, you can use the long options --headers and
              --no-headers to enable printing headers each page or disable headers entirely, respectively.

       -H     Show process hierarchy (forest).

       --headers
              Repeat header lines, one per page of output.

       k spec Specify sorting order.  Sorting syntax is [+|-]key[,[+|-]key[,...]].  Choose a multi-letter key from the STANDARD FORMAT
              SPECIFIERS section.  The &quot;+&quot; is optional since default direction is increasing numerical or lexicographic order.  Identical
              to --sort.

                      Examples:
                      ps jaxkuid,-ppid,+pid
                      ps axk comm o comm,args
                      ps kstart_time -ef

       --lines n
              Set screen height.

       -n namelist
              Set namelist file.  Identical to N.  The namelist file is needed for a proper WCHAN display, and must match the current Linux
              kernel exactly for correct output.  Without this option, the default search path for the namelist is:

                      $PS_SYSMAP
                      $PS_SYSTEM_MAP
                      /proc/*/wchan
                      /boot/System.map-$(uname -r)
                      /boot/System.map
                      /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/System.map
                      /usr/src/linux/System.map
                      /System.map

       n      Numeric output for WCHAN and USER (including all types of UID and GID).

       N namelist
              Specify namelist file.  Identical to -n, see -n above.

       --no-headers
              Print no header line at all.  --no-heading is an alias for this option.

       O order
              Sorting order (overloaded).  The BSD O option can act like -O (user-defined output format with some common fields predefined)
              or can be used to specify sort order.  Heuristics are used to determine the behavior of this option.  To ensure that the
              desired behavior is obtained (sorting or formatting), specify the option in some other way (e.g.  with -O or --sort).

              For sorting, obsolete BSD O option syntax is O[+|-]k1[,[+|-]k2[,...]].  It orders the processes listing according to the
              multilevel sort specified by the sequence of one-letter short keys k1,k2, ...  described in the OBSOLETE SORT KEYS section
              below.  The &quot;+&quot; is currently optional, merely re-iterating the default direction on a key, but may help to distinguish an O
              sort from an O format.  The &quot;-&quot; reverses direction only on the key it precedes.

       --rows n
              Set screen height.

       S      Sum up some information, such as CPU usage, from dead child processes into their parent.  This is useful for examining a
              system where a parent process repeatedly forks off short-lived children to do work.

       --sort spec
              Specify sorting order.  Sorting syntax is [+|-]key[,[+|-]key[,...]].  Choose a multi-letter key from the STANDARD FORMAT
              SPECIFIERS section.  The &quot;+&quot; is optional since default direction is increasing numerical or lexicographic order.  Identical
              to k.  For example: ps jax --sort=uid,-ppid,+pid

       w      Wide output.  Use this option twice for unlimited width.

       -w     Wide output.  Use this option twice for unlimited width.

       --width n
              Set screen width.

THREAD DISPLAY
       H      Show threads as if they were processes.

       -L     Show threads, possibly with LWP and NLWP columns.

       m      Show threads after processes.

       -m     Show threads after processes.

       -T     Show threads, possibly with SPID column.

OTHER INFORMATION
       --help section
              Print a help message.  The section argument can be one of simple, list, output, threads, misc or all.  The argument can be
              shortened to one of the underlined letters as in: s|l|o|t|m|a.

       --info Print debugging info.

       L      List all format specifiers.

       V      Print the procps-ng version.

       -V     Print the procps-ng version.

       --version
              Print the procps-ng version.

NOTES
       This ps works by reading the virtual files in /proc.  This ps does not need to be setuid kmem or have any privileges to run.  Do not
       give this ps any special permissions.

       This ps needs access to namelist data for proper WCHAN display.  For kernels prior to 2.6, the System.map file must be installed.

       CPU usage is currently expressed as the percentage of time spent running during the entire lifetime of a process.  This is not
       ideal, and it does not conform to the standards that ps otherwise conforms to.  CPU usage is unlikely to add up to exactly 100%.

       The SIZE and RSS fields don&apos;</span>t count some parts of a process including the page tables, kernel stack, struct thread_info, and struct
       task_struct.  This is usually at least 20 KiB of memory that is always resident.  SIZE is the virtual size of the process (code+
       data+stack).

       Processes marked &lt;defunct&gt; are dead processes (so-called <span class="hljs-string">&quot;zombies&quot;</span>) that remain because their parent has not destroyed them
       properly.  These processes will be destroyed by init(8) <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> the parent process exits.

       If the length of the username is greater than the length of the display column, the numeric user ID is displayed instead.

       Commands options such as ps -aux are not recommended as it is a confusion of two different standards.  According to the POSIX and
       UNIX standards, the above <span class="hljs-built_in">command</span> asks to display all processes with a TTY (generally the commands users are running) plus all
       processes owned by a user named <span class="hljs-string">&quot;x&quot;</span>.  If that user doesn<span class="hljs-string">&apos;t exist, then ps will assume you really meant &quot;ps aux&quot;.

PROCESS FLAGS
       The sum of these values is displayed in the &quot;F&quot; column, which is provided by the flags output specifier:

               1    forked but didn&apos;</span>t <span class="hljs-built_in">exec</span>
               4    used super-user privileges

PROCESS STATE CODES
       Here are the different values that the s, <span class="hljs-built_in">stat</span> and state output specifiers (header <span class="hljs-string">&quot;STAT&quot;</span> or <span class="hljs-string">&quot;S&quot;</span>) will display to describe the state
       of a process:

               D    uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
               R    running or runnable (on run queue)
               S    interruptible sleep (waiting <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> an event to complete)
               T    stopped by job control signal
               t    stopped by debugger during the tracing
               W    paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)
               X    dead (should never be seen)
               Z    defunct (<span class="hljs-string">&quot;zombie&quot;</span>) process, terminated but not reaped by its parent

       For BSD formats and when the <span class="hljs-built_in">stat</span> keyword is used, additional characters may be displayed:

               &lt;    high-priority (not nice to other users)
               N    low-priority (nice to other users)
               L    has pages locked into memory (<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> real-time and custom IO)
               s    is a session leader
               l    is multi-threaded (using CLONE_THREAD, like NPTL pthreads <span class="hljs-keyword">do</span>)
               +    is <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> the foreground process group

OBSOLETE SORT KEYS
       These keys are used by the BSD O option (when it is used <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> sorting).  The GNU --sort option doesn<span class="hljs-string">&apos;t use these keys, but the
       specifiers described below in the STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS section.  Note that the values used in sorting are the internal values
       ps uses and not the &quot;cooked&quot; values used in some of the output format fields (e.g.  sorting on tty will sort into device number, not
       according to the terminal name displayed).  Pipe ps output into the sort(1) command if you want to sort the cooked values.

AIX FORMAT DESCRIPTORS
       This ps supports AIX format descriptors, which work somewhat like the formatting codes of printf(1) and printf(3).  For example, the
       normal default output can be produced with this: ps -eo &quot;%p %y %x %c&quot;.  The NORMAL codes are described in the next section.

       CODE   NORMAL   HEADER
       %C     pcpu     %CPU
       %G     group    GROUP
       %P     ppid     PPID
       %U     user     USER
       %a     args     COMMAND

       %y     tty      TTY
       %z     vsz      VSZ

STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS
       Here are the different keywords that may be used to control the output format (e.g. with option -o) or to sort the selected
       processes with the GNU-style --sort option.

       For example: ps -eo pid,user,args --sort user

       This version of ps tries to recognize most of the keywords used in other implementations of ps.

       The following user-defined format specifiers may contain spaces: args, cmd, comm, command, fname, ucmd, ucomm,
       lstart, bsdstart, start.

       Some keywords may not be available for sorting.


       CODE        HEADER    DESCRIPTION

       %cpu        %CPU      cpu utilization of the process in &quot;##.#&quot; format.  Currently, it is the CPU time used divided by the time the
                             process has been running (cputime/realtime ratio), expressed as a percentage.  It will not add up to 100%
                             unless you are lucky.  (alias pcpu).

       %mem        %MEM      ratio of the process&apos;</span>s resident <span class="hljs-built_in">set</span> size  to the physical memory on the machine, expressed as a percentage.
                             (<span class="hljs-built_in">alias</span> pmem).

       args        COMMAND   <span class="hljs-built_in">command</span> with all its arguments as a string. Modifications to the arguments may be shown.  The output <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> this
                             column may contain spaces.  A process marked &lt;defunct&gt; is partly dead, waiting to be fully destroyed by its
                             parent.  Sometimes the process args will be unavailable; when this happens, ps will instead <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span> the
                             executable name <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> brackets.  (<span class="hljs-built_in">alias</span> cmd, <span class="hljs-built_in">command</span>).  See also the comm format keyword, the <span class="hljs-_">-f</span> option, and the
                             c option.
                             When specified last, this column will extend to the edge of the display.  If ps can not determine display
                             width, as when output is redirected (piped) into a file or another <span class="hljs-built_in">command</span>, the output width is undefined (it
                             may be 80, unlimited, determined by the TERM variable, and so on).  The COLUMNS environment variable or --cols
                             option may be used to exactly determine the width <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> this case.  The w or -w option may be also be used to
                             adjust width.

       bsdstart    START     time the <span class="hljs-built_in">command</span> started.  If the process was started less than 24 hours ago, the output format is <span class="hljs-string">&quot; HH:MM&quot;</span>,

       _XPG
          Cancel CMD_ENV=irix non-standard behavior.

       In general, it is a bad idea to set these variables.  The one exception is CMD_ENV or PS_PERSONALITY, which could be set to Linux
       for normal systems.  Without that setting, ps follows the useless and bad parts of the Unix98 standard.

AUTHOR
       ps was originally written by Branko Lankester &#x27E8;lankeste@fwi.uva.nl&#x27E9;.  Michael K. Johnson &#x27E8;johnsonm@redhat.com&#x27E9; re-wrote it signifi&#x2010;
       cantly to use the proc filesystem, changing a few things in the process.  Michael Shields &#x27E8;mjshield@nyx.cs.du.edu&#x27E9; added the
       pid-list feature.  Charles Blake &#x27E8;cblake@bbn.com&#x27E9; added multi-level sorting, the dirent-style library, the device name-to-number
       mmaped database, the approximate binary search directly on System.map, and many code and documentation cleanups.  David Moss&#x2010;
       berger-Tang wrote the generic BFD support for psupdate.  Albert Cahalan &#x27E8;albert@users.sf.net&#x27E9; rewrote ps for full Unix98 and BSD
       support, along with some ugly hacks for obsolete and foreign syntax.
